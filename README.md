Spock 101 Presentation

Spock is the powerful testing framework included in Groovy right out of the box. Build upon the JUnit runner, it is compatible with most languages and tools in the JVM world. In fact, for many Java developers, it is the initial contact with the Groovy language.

This presentation starts at the beginning. It explains Spock from the ground up so that you can use it right away in your projects. Learn how given/when/then, assertions, data tables, and more make testing fun.

The main part of this repository is the PDF with the presentation slides. The code examples are included for further experimentation.
